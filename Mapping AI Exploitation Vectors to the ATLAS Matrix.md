MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) provides a structured taxonomy for understanding how adversaries target machine learning and generative AI systems. Unlike traditional cybersecurity frameworks that focus on software bugs, ATLAS addresses the inherent vulnerabilities in model logic, training data, and inference pipelines.

## Mapping AI Exploitation Vectors to the ATLAS Matrix

The framework is organized into 14 tactics, each representing a high-level adversarial objective. Below is a detailed mapping of common AI exploitation vectors to these tactics.

---

### Phase 1: Preparation and Access

RECONNAISSANCE (AML.TA0001)
Adversaries begin by gathering intelligence on the target model.

* Search for Victim Publicly Available Research Materials: Attackers look for academic papers or blog posts by the target organization that describe model architectures, hyperparameters, or training datasets.
* Discover ML Artifacts: Identifying the specific versions of open-source models (e.g., Llama 3, Stable Diffusion) the organization is using.

RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (AML.TA0002)
Setting up the infrastructure needed for the attack.

* Acquire Public ML Artifacts: Downloading the same base models or datasets used by the victim to build "proxy models" for offline testing.
* Develop Adversarial ML Attack Capabilities: Weaponizing research tools like the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) or custom prompt-injection scripts.

INITIAL ACCESS (AML.TA0003)
Gaining the first foothold into the AI system.

* LLM Prompt Injection (AML.T0051): Exploiting the model’s inability to distinguish between system instructions and user-provided data. This is the primary vector for gaining control over an LLM's logic.
* ML Supply Chain Compromise: Uploading a malicious model weight file (e.g., a "pickled" file containing a reverse shell) to a repository like Hugging Face.

### Phase 2: Model Manipulation and Exploitation

ML MODEL ACCESS (AML.TA0004)
Adversaries seek different levels of interaction with the model.

* ML Model Inference API Access: Gaining the ability to query the model and observe outputs, which is necessary for model extraction or "black-box" evasion attacks.

ML ATTACK STAGING (AML.TA0012)
Tailoring the attack using the gained access.

* Create Proxy ML Model: Building a local version of the target model to find adversarial perturbations that will likely transfer to the real system.
* Poison Training Data (AML.T0020): Injecting malicious samples into the training pipeline to create a "backdoor" trigger. For example, a facial recognition system could be trained to ignore anyone wearing a specific pair of glasses.

DEFENSE EVASION (AML.TA0008)
Bypassing security filters and model guardrails.

* Adversarial Perturbation: Modifying an input (like an image or audio file) with noise that is invisible to humans but causes the model to misclassify it.
* LLM Jailbreak: Using sophisticated social engineering prompts (e.g., "Do Anything Now" or "Crescendo" attacks) to bypass safety alignment.

---

### Phase 3: Post-Exploitation and Impact

COLLECTION (AML.TA0011) AND EXFILTRATION (AML.TA0013)
Stealing sensitive data or the model itself.

* LLM Meta Prompt Extraction: Forcing a model to reveal its internal system instructions (its "identity" or "hidden rules").
* Data from AI Services: Using a compromised agent to query internal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) databases to extract proprietary documents.

IMPACT (AML.TA0014)
Achieving the final malicious goal.

* Denial of ML Service: Overloading an inference endpoint with complex, resource-heavy queries to crash the system or spike API costs (LLM-jacking).
* External Harms: Causing reputational or physical damage by forcing the AI to provide dangerous instructions or biased medical advice.
